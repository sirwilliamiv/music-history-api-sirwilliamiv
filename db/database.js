// <Setup the configuration module for knex and bookshelf>

// I have already run 'knex init' at the root of this project to create the knexfile.js.
// The music history database lives right here as a document in this project, so note
// that the devlopment configuration sets that environment to use sqlite instead of postgres.

// No need to make migrations, since the db and tables already exist
